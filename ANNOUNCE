**************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 2.8.0 is now available.

1.1 What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=========================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

1.2 Changes in version '2.8.0'
==============================

   * Better library combo and ABI detection: gnustep-make will now
     attempt to detect the optimal library combo and ABI supported by
     the installed compiler and Objective-C runtime library.  Explicit
     selection of the runtime ABI is now possible using the
     '--with-runtime-abi' configure option.

   * Full support for the gnustep-2.0 Objective-C ABI.

   * Support for creating a Git tag and creating a tarball from a git
     tag using the 'git-tag' and 'git-dist' targets.

   * Support for creating a Mercurial tag and creating a tarball from a
     hg tag using the 'hg-tag' and 'hg-dist' targets.

   * Dropped legacy Rhapsody and FreeBSD-out support.

1.3 Changes in version '2.7.0'
==============================

Garbage collection support removed

   ARC enabled by default if the ng runtime is used

   Multi-architecture directory layout adjusted to be more Debian
compatible
